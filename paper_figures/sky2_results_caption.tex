\caption{Sky 2 Results - Afternoon descent sequence analysis. (a) Sample sky frames showing sun elevation descent during afternoon hours across key timestamps, with accompanying elevation progression plot. (b) Corresponding relit building images demonstrating dynamic shadow movement and warm lighting transitions characteristic of late afternoon illumination. (c) Close-up shadow region detail highlighting soft edge quality achieved through Gaussian blur post-processing. (d) Temporal consistency analysis showing frame-to-frame difference maps with PSNR measurements indicating smooth transitions. (e) Final composited results combining relit building with sky backgrounds. The sequence demonstrates robust handling of warm afternoon lighting conditions with stable shadow rendering and temporally coherent transitions.}
