\caption{Ablation studies demonstrating the impact of key pipeline components. Top row shows full frame comparisons, bottom row displays zoomed regions highlighting detailed differences in shadow quality and color rendering. (a) Full model baseline with all features enabled, serving as the reference for comparison. (b) Removing the color-preserving lighting model results in desaturated output with neutral gray color temperature—warm tones are lost and the scene appears washed out. (c) Disabling shadow computation eliminates critical depth cues that ground objects in the scene, though processing speed improves by approximately 60ms per frame. (d) Strided sampling ($r=10$) provides efficient shadow computation with slightly coarser shadow edges but 10× faster processing. (e) Uniform sampling ($r=1$) produces slightly smoother shadow boundaries but at significantly higher computational cost. The comparison between (d) and (e) validates that strided sampling offers an optimal quality-speed tradeoff for real-time applications. Each ablation demonstrates the necessity of its corresponding component for achieving realistic relighting results.}
