\caption{Sky 1 Results - Morning-to-noon sequence analysis. (a) Sample sky frames showing sun elevation progression from 15° to 65° across key timestamps, with accompanying elevation progression plot. (b) Corresponding relit building images demonstrating dynamic shadow movement and lighting transitions as the sun rises. (c) Close-up shadow region detail highlighting soft edge quality achieved through Gaussian blur post-processing. (d) Temporal consistency analysis showing frame-to-frame difference maps with PSNR measurements indicating smooth transitions (average 38.2 dB). (e) Final composited results combining relit building with sky backgrounds. The sequence demonstrates robust lighting transitions from warm orange morning light (2800K equivalent) to neutral white noon illumination (5500K equivalent).}
