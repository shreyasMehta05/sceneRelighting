\caption{Combined sun trajectory visualization for all three test sky sequences. Top row (1(a)-3(a)): Sun paths in image space overlaid on representative sky frames. Bottom row (1(b)-3(b)): Corresponding 3D direction vectors on the unit sphere. (1(a),1(b)) Sky 1 morning-to-noon transition (214 frames, elevation 15\degree\rightarrow65\degree). (2(a),2(b)) Sky 2 afternoon descent (291 frames, warm lighting conditions). (3(a),3(b)) Sky 3 overcast sequence (158 frames, diffuse illumination). The visualization demonstrates robust sun tracking across diverse weather conditions with temporally coherent trajectories and accurate 3D direction estimation.}
