\caption{Sky 3 Results - Overcast sequence analysis. (a) Sample sky frames showing diffuse illumination conditions with reduced sun visibility across key timestamps, with accompanying elevation progression plot. (b) Corresponding relit building images demonstrating subtle shadow variations under overcast conditions with diffuse lighting. (c) Close-up shadow region detail highlighting soft edge quality maintained even with diffuse illumination. (d) Temporal consistency analysis showing frame-to-frame difference maps with PSNR measurements indicating smooth transitions despite challenging lighting conditions. (e) Final composited results combining relit building with overcast sky backgrounds. The sequence demonstrates the system's robustness in handling challenging diffuse lighting scenarios with reduced shadow contrast while maintaining temporal coherence.}
