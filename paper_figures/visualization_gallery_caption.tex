\caption{Pipeline visualization gallery showing comprehensive system outputs. (a) 3D sun trajectory animation displaying temporal solar path evolution with elevation and azimuth progression across the complete sky sequence. (b) Interactive geometry annotation interface demonstrating vanishing point detection and wall boundary specification for scene reconstruction. (c) Ray tracing analysis visualization showing hit statistics, shadow coverage maps, and geometric intersection computations. (d) Shadow trajectory evolution across multiple frames demonstrating temporal shadow movement synchronized with sun position changes. (e) Lighting parameter evolution over time showing intensity modulation and color temperature transitions corresponding to different times of day. (f) Temporal consistency metrics across complete sky sequences with frame-to-frame coherence analysis and stability measurements. The gallery demonstrates the pipeline's comprehensive visualization capabilities for debugging, analysis, and result presentation.}
